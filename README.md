# Features

1. User Accounts: User registration and authentication are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

2. Meme Management: Users can upload their own memes to the portal. In addition, there is an interactive meme board, the main feature of Memeland Portal, where users can browse a wide variety of memes, like them, and post comments.

3. Random Meme Generator: Feeling lucky? Click on the "Losuj mema!" button to get a random meme.

4. Notification System: Stay up-to-date with our notification system, which alerts you to new likes and comments on your memes.

# Technologies Used

1. React: The front-end of Memeland Portal is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a dynamic and responsive user experience.

2. Django REST Framework: The back-end is powered by Django REST Framework, a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It handles user authentication, meme management, and notifications.

3. PostgreSQL: The database is managed by PostgreSQL, a robust and open-source relational database system.

4. AWS S3: For storing and serving meme images, we use Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, a scalable object storage service.
